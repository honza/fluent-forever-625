* Directions
Note: You may not find all of these in your glossary, and you may have trouble
finding pictures even if you do. That’s fine. Skip them for now, or use my
collection of images for directions and prepositions at

* Numbers
Note: If you search for a number (uno (one), dos (two), tres (three)), you’ll
find pictures of objects (1 apple, 2 monkeys, etc.). This usually works until
10. Then search for the digits (10, 11, 12). You’ll find colorful numerals,
address signs, etc. Use these images (picture of hotel room #33) instead of
text (#33); these pictures easier to remember and they don’t get mixed up as
easily.

Note: You’ll usually find pictures of holidays and weather. Add in the number
of each month (#1-12) to get more specific.

** August

** December
* Days of the week
Note: You’ll usually find pictures of people going to work on Mondays and
partying on Fridays/Saturdays, etc. To get more specific, use an image of a
weekly calendar with weekends greyed out and indicate which day you want.
I’ll find a few good calendars to use and post them here in the near future.
** Monday
** Tuesday
** Wednesday
** Thursday
** Friday
** Saturday
** Sunday
* Time
Note: You’ll find pictures of clocks and calendars. If needed, define each
time division in terms of another time division,
i.e. 60 x minuto = 1 ___ (ora), 1 ora = 60 x ____ (minuto).
Don’t worry about plural forms (you don’t need the word for “minutes” yet)

** evening

* Verbs
Note: For verbs, you’ll probably need to learn your language’s word for
“verb” and add it to any verb that could masquerade as a noun (to kiss vs a
kiss). Basically, get a picture of two people kissing, add the word “Verb”
underneath, and poof, you’ve got a pretty clear “to kiss.”
